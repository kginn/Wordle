Two short projects I worked on my freshman year of college. 
The first is a simple wordle game that runs in the terminal.
The second is a solver that takes inputs of a five letter word 
and the color recived in wordle and returns a list of possible answers 
along with the option to show a "score" for the next guess that correlates to how many words it might eliminate.
